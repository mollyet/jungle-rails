## Setup

- Clone this repo into your favourite directory
- Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
- Run `bin/rake db:reset` to create, load and seed db
- Run `bin/rails s -b 0.0.0.0` to start the server
- Navigate to `localhost:3000` and go (fake) shopping!

## Future Improvmenets/Next Steps

- Better styling. Due to time constraints, this was neglected in favor of learning Rails functionality 
- More Tests. I enjoy writing tests, and I want to do more in the future. 

## Dependencies

- Rails 4.2 [Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v4.2/)
- PostgreSQL 9.x
- Stripe
